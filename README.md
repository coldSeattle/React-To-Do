# React To Do App

Try: [React To Do App](https://react-cs-to-do.herokuapp.com/#/)

First of all I draw your attention to what I using in this project redux, redux-saga and typescript
This project could only be written in [React](https://ru.reactjs.org/) and there is no need for [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) at all.
So here I use all this as an example of how I use them together, because on real projects with React they always use state containers for storing data(Redux and etc.). And the Typecript is here for an example of how I type React-Redax applications.

# Stack:
* React
* Redux
* react-redux
* react-router-dom
* redux-devtools-extension
* redux-logger
* react-responsive
* react-toggle
* axios
* node-sass
* json-server
* typescript
* eslint

First of all:

Git clone(HTTPS)
```
git clone https://github.com/coldSeattle/React-To-Do.git
```

Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Run:
```
npm run start
```
And in another console:
```
npm run fake-json
```
